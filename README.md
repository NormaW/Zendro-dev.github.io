# ScienceDB 

ScienceDb is a set of modular projects which objective is to provide tools for a creation of a standarized platform which will allow the user to store, to magane and to retrieve data in a easy way. For this purpose data models belonging to a same cocept should be first defined and this data models will be used as input for ScienceDb tools. 

ScienceDB tools are mainly code generators which can be used with data models in a flexible way, meaning that each time the data model change then the code generator can re-generate the code accordingly.  

ScienceDb is conformed of two main components, backend and frontend. The backend component has its [base project](https://github.com/ScienceDb/graphql-server) and a [code generator](https://github.com/ScienceDb/graphql-server-model-codegen). The frontend of SPA(Single Page Application) also has its [base project](https://github.com/ScienceDb/single-page-app) and a [code generator](https://github.com/ScienceDb/single-page-app-codegen).
About how to use ScienceDB tools see tutorials below.
