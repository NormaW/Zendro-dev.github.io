# How to create a complet ScienceDB project from scratch

In this section will learn how to use the set of repositories to get a full ScienceDB project working. A full ScienceDB project contains backend and frontend running.

Given a set of data models, ScienceDB will allow you to create a graphql server. This server will, by default, have the functionality of basic CRUD operations for each data model specified in the input.
